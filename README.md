# Golf-Swing-Tracker
This is the start of a golf tracking program that takes in a cropped video, tracks the path of the club, and outputs the path painted onto the video.

I have plans to create a ball flight tracking software bundle to go along with this but that is a future issue.

Some test videos have been included.
