# Golf-Swing-Tracker
This is the start of a golf tracking program that takes in a cropped video, tracks the path of the club, and outputs the path painted onto the video.

I have plans to create a ball flight tracking software bundle to go along with this but that is a future issue.

Some test videos have been included to replicate results shown in the paper.
To run the notebook, hit run all and it will create all of the required directories and then run through the videos and output the results into the relevant directories.
